# **Interactive Articles Platform**

This project is an interactive article platform that allows users to create, edit, and answer multiple-choice questions (MCQs). The application is built with a **frontend (Next.js with TypeScript)** and a **backend (Node.js with TypeScript & Express)**, supporting AI-powered question analysis.

## **üìå Design Decisions & Tradeoffs**
1. **Tiptap Editor for MCQ Integration:**  
   - The editor was chosen for flexibility in embedding interactive questions.
   - A tradeoff was handling custom question blocks, which required additional extensions.

2. **AI Analysis for MCQs:**  
   - Implemented basic AI analysis for evaluating MCQs.
   - Performance tradeoff: AI processing adds minor latency.

3. **Simplified Backend Storage:**  
   - Currently using a **JSON-based storage or in-memory database** for simplicity.
   - Tradeoff: Not fully scalable yet but easy to extend with a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Future Improvements**
- Implement a database for persistent storage.
- Enhance AI-based MCQ analysis.
- Improve UI/UX for better question management.
